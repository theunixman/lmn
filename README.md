###Install postgresql

https://github.com/DjangoGirls/tutorial-extensions/blob/master/optional_postgresql_installation/README.md

Set admin password, remember it.

Start postgres running

`su postgres ` if on a mac/linux
`pg_ctl start`  enter username and password

start postgres shell with `psql`

Create a user called lmnop

`create user lmnop with password 'password_here'; `

create a database lmnop

`create database owner lmnop;`

Various postgres shell commands 
connect to lmnop database 

`\c lmnop`

`\dt`    shows tables
`\d table_name`   shows info (and constraints) for a table
other sql as expected

postgres shell command cheatsheet - https://gist.github.com/Kartones/dd3ff5ec5ea238d4c546

set environment variable called
POSTGRES_LMNOP_USER_PASSWORD
with a value of the lmnop user's password


(Mac users may need to run these commands; these one time 

`sudo ln -s /Library/PosgreSQL/9.5/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib
sudo ln -s /Library/PosgreSQL/9.5/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib`

And this when you start a new shell; or set it permanently in .bash_profile 
`export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`
)

python manage.py test lmn.tests.test_views.TestUserAuthentication
python manage.py test lmn.tests.test_views.TestUserAuthentication.test_user_registration_logs_user_in



### Functional Tests with selenium

Install (upgrade to the latest version if you already have it) Firefox browser. It works best for automated functional testing with Selenium.

geckodriver needs to be in path or you need to tell selenim where it is. Pick an approach: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40208051/selenium-using-python-geckodriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path
